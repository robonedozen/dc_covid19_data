# dc_covid19_data

This is my personal project where I wanted to:
1. Look at and download the publicly-available data offered by DC government on https://coronavirus.dc.gov/page/coronavirus-data
2. Calculate the percentage of total tested that result in positives
3. Create a few different versions of line charts (basic, animated, bokeh) showing this percentage over time.

I make no claim in the accuracy of this data (and I understand that the more recent data available "are preliminary and are subject to change based on additional reporting") nor should this be used for any epidemiological study.

If the charts are not showing properly, please try https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/robonedozen/dc_covid19_data/blob/master/DC%20COVID%20Data_2020-09-19.ipynb

*Current charts use data from March 13, 2020 through September 20, 2020
