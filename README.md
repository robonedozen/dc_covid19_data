# dc_covid19_data

This is my personal project where I wanted to:
1. Look at and download the publicly-available data offered by DC government on https://coronavirus.dc.gov/page/coronavirus-data
2. Calculate the percentage of total tested that result in positives
3. Create a few different versions of line charts showing this percentage over time.

I make no claim in the accuracy of this data (and I understand that the more recent data available "are preliminary and are subject to change based on additional reporting") nor should this be used for any epidemiological study.
